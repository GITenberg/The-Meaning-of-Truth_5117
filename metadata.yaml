description: Philosopher, psychologist, educator, and author William James ranked
  among the most influential figures of his time. James played a prominent role in
  the transition from a predominantly European-centered nineteenth century philosophy
  to a new pragmatic American philosophy. One of his chief contributions lay in his
  seminal 1907 work, Pragmatism, which featured a controversial chapter on "truth."
  In response to his critics- most of whom had misunderstood his thesis - James wrote
  The meaning of Truth, a synthesis of everything he had ever written on the theory
  of knowledge, including and article on the function of cognition, later polemic
  and expository contributions and some replies to previous criticism.
